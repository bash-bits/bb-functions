### [ðŸ“‚ Importing / Installing BB-Functions](README.md)

Like all of `Bash-Bits`, the easiest way to install `BB-Functions` is using `BB-Import`!

However, because BB-Functions itself is made up of a collection of smaller files, BB-Import works a little differently here.

If you use an `Implicit Import` to import BB-Functions, then BB-Import will cache every `type` file used by BB-Functions as well: 

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash

bb::import bb-functions
```

If you use what looks like a Namespaced Import (but is actually a special kind of Implicit Import) to import BB-Functions, then BB-Import will import ONLY the type file that you've specified with the import command for now.

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash

bb::import bb-functions/array
```

If you don't want to import any more type files than you need for the moment, that's fine - BB-Import will gradually import the remaining files over the next few hours.
